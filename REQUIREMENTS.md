### Requirements Design for Data Import Quality Assessment Web App

### Current Status

As of the latest update, significant progress has been made on the backend development. The following components have been implemented:

1. **Backend Framework**: FastAPI has been set up and is operational.
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL integration is complete.
3. **Authentication**: User authentication system is in place, likely using JWT.
4. **Data Import**: Basic functionality for importing CSV files is implemented.
5. **Data Validation**: A validation system is in place, supporting various validation rules.

### What's Working

1. **User Management**: User registration and login functionality is operational.
2. **Data Import**: The system can accept and store CSV file uploads.
3. **Data Validation**: Basic validation rules are implemented and functioning, including:
   - Minimum and maximum length validation
   - Regular expression validation
   - Required field validation
   - Email format validation
   - Country code validation
4. **Database Operations**: CRUD operations for users, imported data, and validation results are functional.

### Next Steps

1. **XLSX Support**: Implement support for XLSX file format imports.
2. **Advanced Data Structures**: Develop functionality to handle complex data structures with non-traditional start coordinates.
3. **Tax ID Validation**: Implement country-specific tax ID validation.
4. **Password Validation**: Add more robust password validation rules.
5. **Data Streaming**: Implement data streaming capabilities for large file handling.
6. **Frontend Development**: Begin development of the React-based frontend.
7. **Address Validation**: Start integration with Google's address API.

### Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization**: The system may need optimization for handling large datasets efficiently.
2. **Data Storage**: The current method of storing imported data as binary might limit query and validation capabilities. This approach may need review and potential refactoring.
3. **Scalability Testing**: The system's ability to handle concurrent users and large data volumes needs to be tested and potentially improved.

### Remaining Functional Requirements

1. **Data Content Variation**: 
   - Implement support for various data structures (supplier data, contract data, etc.)
   - Handle non-traditional row and column start coordinates in imported files.
2. **Advanced Validation Rules**:
   - Implement tax ID validation based on country code.
   - Enhance username and password validation.
3. **Address Validation**: 
   - Integrate with Google's address API for comprehensive address validation.

### Non-Functional Requirements (To Be Addressed)

1. **Performance**: 
   - Optimize API to handle large data files more efficiently.
   - Improve validation speed to minimize latency.
2. **Scalability**: 
   - Enhance system architecture to better handle increasing data volumes and concurrent users.
3. **Security**: 
   - Review and enhance data transmission and storage security measures.
   - Implement more robust authorization mechanisms.
4. **Usability**: 
   - Design and implement a user-friendly frontend interface.
   - Develop reactive feedback mechanisms for large dataset processing.
5. **Maintainability**: 
   - Continue to improve code documentation and adhere to best practices.

   - Create dashboard for displaying validation results.
   - Implement user management interface.

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integrations**
   - Integrate with Google Address API.
   - Implement data streaming for large file handling.
   - Develop advanced data structure parsing capabilities.

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Optimization**
   - Conduct comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Perform load testing and optimize for scalability.
   - Address security vulnerabilities.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**
   - Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Azure).
   - Set up monitoring and logging systems.
   - Establish a process for ongoing maintenance and feature enhancements.
