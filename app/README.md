### Requirements Design for Data Import Quality Assessment Web App

### Overview

The objective is to design a web application that acts as an intermediary for importing data into another application, ensuring the data quality based on predefined rules. The application will support CSV and XLSX file formats and will validate data according to different rules, including regular expressions and length criteria. The backend will be built with FastAPI, and the frontend will eventually be developed using React. Integration with Google's address API for address validation is planned for the long term.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Data Import Formats**
    - Support for importing data in CSV and XLSX formats.
2. **Data Content Variation**
    - Ability to handle different data structures depending on the purpose, such as:
        - Supplier data (including tax IDs and addresses)
        - Contract data (including payment terms and banking information)
        - Rows and columns with non-traditional start coordinates. For example, the header and the first row of data can be several rows apart
3. **Data Validation Rules**
    - Implementation of various data validation rules:
        - Regular expressions for specific field formats
        - Minimum and maximum length criteria
        - Tax ID validation based on country code
        - Username validation (minimum of eight characters)
        - Password validation
4. **Address Validation**
    - Integration with Google's address API for address validation (long-term goal)
5. **Backend API**
    - Development of a backend API using FastAPI to:
        - Ingest CSV and XLSX files
        - Assess data quality based on predefined rules
        - Provide authentication mechanisms
        - Support data streaming
        - Manage data using PostgreSQL
6. **Frontend**
    - Development of a frontend using React (future integration)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
    - The API should handle large data files efficiently.
    - Data validation should be performed quickly to minimize latency.
2. **Scalability**
    - The system should be able to scale to handle increasing amounts of data and concurrent users.
3. **Security**
    - Ensure secure data transmission and storage.
    - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4. **Usability**
    - The frontend should provide a user-friendly interface for uploading files and viewing validation results.
    - It is important to provide reactive feedback to users due to the potential size of some data sets.
5. **Maintainability**
    - The codebase should be well-documented and follow best practices to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
